       <h1>Fun facts</h1>
       <h2>STARS</h2>
       <p>looking up into the night sky, you might wonder how many stars are there in the universe.The observable universe appears to go back in 13.8 bliion years, its almost as old as the big bang which is 14 billion years. but beyond what we could see there could be much, much more. some people think we live in whats called the multiverse where there would be other universe like ours containing the milky way. in October 2016, deep field images from the Hubble space telescope suggested that there are 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe, a professor of astrophysics at the university of nottigham in the UK, Said there were about 100 Million stars in the Average galaxy.</p>
       <h2>Black hole</h2>
       <p>Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects in space. they're extremely dense, with such strong gravitational attraction that not even light can escape their grasp. The milky way woyuld contain over 100 million black hole, though detecting these gluttonous beast is very difficult. At the heart of the milky way lies a supermassive black hole


<p>Sagittarius A, Is the supermassive black hole at the center of out galaxy. Its mass is about 	8.26×10^36 kg (4.154±0.014)×10^6[2] M☉
 
The distance is  26673±42[2] ly
(8178±13[2] pc)</P>

<p>The reason why its called Sagittarius goes back to historical reasons. in 1954 john D kraus, Hsien-Ching ko, and Sean matt listed the radio source the indentified with the Ohio state university radio telescope at 250 MHz. they arranged these sources by constellation and then they assinged capital letters in order of brightness within each constellation, with A denoting the brightest radio source within the constellation. The asterisk The observations of several stars orbiting Sagittarius A*, particularly star S2, have been used to determine the mass and upper limits on the radius of the object</P>

<p>Observation and description
On May 12, 2022, the first image of Sagittarius A* was released by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. The image, which is based on radio interferometer data taken in 2017, confirms that the object contains a black hole.
The image took five years of calculations to process.The data were collected by eight radio observatories at six geographical sites. Radio images are produced from data by aperture synthesis. Their result gives an overall angular size for the source of 51.8±2.3 μas.[17] At a distance of 26,000 light-years (8,000 parsecs), this yields a diameter of 51.8 million kilometres (32.2 million miles). For comparison, Earth is 150 million kilometres (1.0 astronomical unit; 93 million miles) from the Sun, and Mercury is 46 million km (0.31 AU; 29 million mi) from the Sun at perihelion. The proper motion of Sgr A* is approximately −2.70 mas per year for the right ascension and −5.6 mas per year for the declination..</p>
       <h2>Earth</h2>
       <p>Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. While scientists continue to hunt for clues of life beyond Earth, our home planet remains the only place in the universe where we've ever identified living organisms.</p>

<p>Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. It's smaller than the four gas giants — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury, Mars and Venus.</P>

<p>Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles(13,000 Km) and its mostly round because gravity.generally pulls matter into a ball. But the spin of our home planet causes it to be squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator, making the true shape of the Earth an "oblate spheroid."</p>

<p>Our planet is unique for many reasons, but its available water and oxygen are two defining features. Water covers roughly 71% of Earth's surface, with most of that water located in our planet's oceans</p>

<p>Fun fact </P>
<p>Our water is About 4.5 Billion years old At least some of it is. According to the authors, planetesimals probably delivered it to Earth, but exactly how that happens isn't clear.</p>

<p>While Earth orbits the sun, the planet is simultaneously spinning around an imaginary line called an axis that runs through the core, from the North Pole to the South Pole. It takes Earth 23.934 hours to complete a rotation on its axis and 365.26 days to complete an orbit around the sun — our days and years on Earth are defined by these gyrations.Earth's axis of rotation is tilted in relation to the ecliptic plane, an imaginary surface through the planet's orbit around the sun. This means the Northern and Southern Hemispheres will sometimes point toward or away from the sun depending on the time of year.</p>

<p>Statistics about Earth's orbit, according to NASA:</p>

  <p> -Average distance from the sun: 92,956,050 miles (149,598,262 km)
   -Perihelion (closest approach to the sun): 91,402,640 miles (147,098,291 km)
    -Aphelion (farthest distance from the sun): 94,509,460 miles (152,098,233 km)
   -Length of solar day (single rotation on its axis): 23.934 hours
   -Length of year (single revolution around the sun): 365.26 days
   -Equatorial inclination to orbit: 23.4393 degrees</p>

<p>Scientists think Earth was formed at roughly the same time as the sun and other planets some 4.6 billion years ago when the solar system coalesced from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula. As the nebula collapsed under the force of its own gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material in that disk was then pulled toward the center to form the sun.Radioactive materials in the rock and increasing pressure deep within the Earth generated enough heat to melt the planet's interior, causing some chemicals to rise to the surface and form water, while others became the gases of the atmosphere. Recent evidence suggests that Earth's crust and oceans may have formed within about 200 million years after the planet took shape..</p>
